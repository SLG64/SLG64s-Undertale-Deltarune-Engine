# SLG64's Undertale/Deltarune Engine
## An Undertale/Deltarune Engine that I decided to work on because I wanted to slack off on my other projects I have been working on.

Welcome! 
  
  This is an engine that is being built into Game Maker LTS. At first, it was just going to be a fan game (Please don't steal it's name from me!!! It's goofy, and I like it.) that I was working on for fun. Now it's public for anyone to use! This engine is meant for anyone who wants to build a Fan game / AU for Undertale or Deltarune. This project aims to have any of the mechanics close to the original game's mechanics, but with a fresh dose of whatever else is possible. I haven't done much work on it yet, but expect more to come! I'll explain more once it has more progress done on it.

# Current Progress
At the moment, overworld "walking" is done. I plan on adding sprinting, enemy encounters, and more for these AUs. I also got a Start-Up screen that anyone can put their logo in, and it includes a credit for me.

I also have many souls complete, and there are custom ones! Allow me to explain:

### DETERMINATION SOUL
The Soul of Determination, or just the default one, is pretty simple to make, actually. This soul has no special abilities, but is nice to have for regular fights. Its movement consists of normal horizontal and vertical movement, using the arrow keys.

### JUSTICE SOUL
This was the second soul I worked on, especially since it's the second soul used in Deltarune, during the secret boss fight with Spamton Neo. The bullet mechanic works pretty well, and there is a projectile that it will shoot. Right now, the key assigned to abilities is ```space```. There is something special I did that doesn't really have any purpose, but I'll explain that later.

### KINDNESS SOUL

PK Fire! Oh wait, I misread the name. The Kindness soul has a shield that is functional, but is highly buggy. It starts out on the side with the sprite for the top on it's side, which I don't know when I'll fix it. However, I have made it bounce the Justice Soul's projectiles off of its shield. However, if angled properly, it will bounce it back and forth, basically storing it. You can do this with multiple of them too!

### INTEGRITY SOUL
This soul was pretty easy to make, just get rid of the down key's functionality, and make the up arrow jump instead of move up. Not much to it, but it's collision is only to the bottom of the battle box.

### BRAVERY SOUL
Still working on this, but my general version has a dash ability that would destroy attacks, and has a 5 second cooldown. I am having an issue with the vertical and horizontal dashing to be correct. Anyways, the soul turns into a darker color, and will revert back to its original color once it's re-charged.

### PERSEVERANCE SOUL
Working decently well! This soul is able to jump between webs, and move left and right on them! I still need to fix how far the soul is able to go before it detects that it isn't on the web any longer.

### SWITCH SOUL
Welp, guess we are switching some things up. The Switch soul, introduced on the Nintendo Switch for the Mad Mew Mew fight (hence the name), is able to be two separate halves, each controllable by their own. The Red half is controlled using the WASD keys, and the Blue half uses the Up, Down, Left, Right keys for movement. When they are idle, they snap back to the Origin, the resting place for the soul to refuse to fight.

### ACCELERATION SOUL (CUSTOM SOUL TYPAGE)
This soul is pretty much exactly like the Determination Soul, except it speeds up when it starts to move. Also, its horizontal movement is slower than the original's. Not much more about it.

## Planned

### PATIENCE SOUL (Deltatraveller)
This is probably the only version of the Patience Soul that has an ability (of which I know of) that would be nice. It has a parrying ability, which is used in the Porky Boss Fight (Earthbound). For now, I should also mention that it's slower than the regular souls. I am going to leave it as a custom, and I will work on my own Patience Soul ability. As of now, there is no work for this soul.

### EXTRAS PLANNED
I do have more souls planned for it, mainly because I find it fun to make them. I know a few souls that would be interesting to implement, such as the soul used in The Final Experiment, an Undertale Fan-Game/AU that has you fight W.D. Gaster (presumably). I will provide code for the basic movement for the souls, especially for creating new souls.

## To-Do List:
Here is my list of things that need to be done, that will come out later on.

 ### Souls
 I need to finish the Bravery Soul, Deltatraveller's Patience Soul, and Grazing Souls. I do plan on adding Accelerating types for most of the souls, just in case. I will also make any extra soul types that I find and take intrest into.

 ### Player
 Frisk and Kris, both for Undertale and Deltarune games. I also need to implement Susie and Ralsei for Kris.

 ### Tilesets
 A tile set for defaults. Yeah...

 ### Sounds
 I need to figure these out, but I will probably just use the default sounds when I get it to work.

 ### Sprites
 Need to finish adding these in at some point.

# Final Thoughts
Now that I have that all out of the way, have fun using this beta version of the engine, made by a single person. If you do use this, please be sure to give me some credit, especially since I try to give people good times.
